/*! \mainpage Overview
 * 
 * MRtrix was developed with simplicity and performance in mind, which has led
 * to a number of fundamental design decisions. The main concepts are explained
 * in the following pages:
 * 
 * - The build process is based on a Python script rather than Makefiles,
 * and all dependencies are resolved at build-time. This is explained in
 * \ref build_page.
 * - The basic steps for writing applications based on MRtrix are explained
 * in the section \ref command_howto.
 * - %Image data are accessed via objects that implement at least a subset of
 * the interface defined for the DataSet abstract class.
 * - Access to data stored in image files is done via the classes and
 * functions defined in the Image namespace. The corresponding headers are
 * stored in the \c lib/image/ directory.
