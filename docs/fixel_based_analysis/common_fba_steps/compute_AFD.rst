Here we segment each FOD lobe to identify the number and orientation of fixels in each voxel. The output also contains the apparent fibre density (AFD) value per fixel estimated as the FOD lobe integral (see `here <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912011615>`_ for details on FOD segmentation). Note that in the following steps we will use a more generic shortened acronym - Fibre Density (FD) instead of AFD, since the following steps can also apply for other measures of fibre density (see the note below). The terminology is also consistent with our `recent work <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27639350>`_::

.. NOTE:: If you would like to perform fixel-based analysis of metrics derived from other diffusion MRI models (e.g. CHARMED), replace steps 14 & 15. For example, in step 14 you can warp preprocessed DW images (also without any reorientation). In step 15 you could then estimate your DWI model of choice, and output the FD related measure to the :ref:`fixel_format`, ready for the subsequent fixel reorientation step.
