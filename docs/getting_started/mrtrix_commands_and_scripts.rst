MRtrix commands and scripts
===========================

With the exception of :ref:`mrview` and :ref:`shview`, all MRtrix executables are designed to be run via a terminal using a consistent `command-line interface <#command-line-usage>`__. While many of the tools and features are discussed is specific sections throughout this documentation, a comprehensive list of MRtrix3 `commands`<#List-of-MRtrix3-commands> and `scripts`<#List-of-MRtrix3-scripts> can be found in the reference section. This list provides links to the help page (manual) for each executable, which can also be accessed by typing the `-help` option after any executable on the terminal.
