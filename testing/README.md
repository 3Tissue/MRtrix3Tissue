To test your MRtrix3Tissue installation, run `./run_tests` in the MRtrix3Tissue folder, after a complete and successful install via `./configure` and `./build`.

Check the contents of `testing.log` for details of the results. If _all_ tests fail, try first running `./build` again, followed by `./run_tests`.
